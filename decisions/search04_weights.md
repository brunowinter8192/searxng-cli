# Search Pipeline Step 4: Engine Weights

> **⚠️ Superseded (2026-04-15 engine-cut):** This file documents per-engine weights in the SearXNG-Docker settings.yml. That config (src/searxng/settings.yml, deleted 2026-04-15) no longer exists. Current ranking is slot-based (12 general / 6 academic / 2 Q&A) with overlap-counting, documented in `decisions/search07_ranking_format.md`.

## Status Quo (Historical, pre-engine-cut)

**Code:** src/searxng/settings.yml (deleted 2026-04-15, engines section)
**Method:** Static per-engine weights influencing SearXNG's internal score formula

### Current Weights

| Engine | Category | Weight | Proxy |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| google | general | 2 | direct |
| bing | general | 1 | direct |
| mojeek | general | 1 | direct |
| brave | general | 2 | Tor |
| startpage | general | 1 | Tor |
| duckduckgo | general | — | disabled |
| google scholar | general | 2 | — |
| semantic scholar | general | 2 | — |
| crossref | general | 1 | — |
| arxiv | plugin | 2 | — |
| github | plugin | 1 | — |
| reddit | plugin | 1 | — |

Weight rationale (initial): Google and Brave assigned weight=2 as highest-quality web engines; Scholar engines (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar) weight=2 for academic coverage; discovery-only plugin engines lower.

## Evidenz

_Pending — consensus evaluation script was never built (planned as 10_engine_consensus.py but not implemented)._

Metrics to collect per engine:
- Consensus Rate (% of URLs found by ≥2 engines)
- Unique URLs (discovery value)
- Avg Position in combined ranking
- Top-20 Coverage

## Recommendation (SOLL)

Pending — needs consensus evaluation (script not built yet).

## Offene Fragen

- Do high-weight engines (google, brave) dominate consensus, or do lower-weight engines contribute disproportionate unique value?
- Is Crossref weight=1 too low given its role in academic queries?
- SearXNG score formula: `weight = Π(engine_weights) × len(positions)`, `score = Σ(weight / position_i)` — does weight amplification warrant non-linear scaling?
- Plugin engines (arxiv, github, reddit) are discovery-only; their weight affects ranking of the discovery URL. Is weight=2 for arxiv appropriate?
