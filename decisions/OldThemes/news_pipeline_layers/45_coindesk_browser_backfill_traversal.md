# 45 — CoinDesk backfill traversal: false-DISABLED fix + DOM-growth measurement

Builds on OT44 (timeline API confirmed as the right pagination surface). This entry covers the
first implementation of the uncapped browser-driven backfill traversal, the premature termination
bug encountered in Stage A, the fix, and the open performance problem before a full run.

## Script

`dev/news_pipeline/exploration/03_coindesk_backfill_traversal.py` — pydoll headed Chrome
(`open -gna "Google Chrome"` + CDP), copy of production `discover.py` machinery (no src/ import),
plateau tolerance 3, DISABLED retry tolerance 3, crash-safe checkpoint every 50 clicks.
Output shape: identical to `build_entries()` — `{url, lastmod, publication_date, title, section}`.

## Stage A first run — false DISABLED at click 127

First bounded run (cap=400) stopped at click 127 with `button DISABLED` and oldest=2026-03-10
(~3 months back). Checkpoint had 2031 URLs, 24 live-blog URLs filtered, 2007 entries output.

**This was a false stop.** OT44 depth probe ran 150 clicks → 2414 URLs, oldest 2026-01-23
(~5 months back), button still ACTIVE. Same feed, same day. If 2026-03-10 were a genuine floor,
the depth probe could not have gone deeper.

**Investigation:** targeted pydoll test confirmed transient-disabled exists (250ms window,
seen at t=0.28s → active at t=0.53s, 1 of 5 clicks), but that window is far shorter than
the ~4.2s click cycle. A transient from click N cannot bleed into click N+1's pre-check
(4.2s later). The DISABLED at click 127 was a one-time race anomaly: the delayed-cursor-exhaustion
mechanism (React disabling button after last-cursor API response) fired during the
click 126 cycle, and the pre-check at click 127 caught the persistent-looking state before
the button could be re-evaluated. Root cause not fully deterministic — single anomalous timing.

## Fix — DISABLED retry tolerance

Added `DISABLED_RETRY_MAX = 3`, `DISABLED_RETRY_WAIT = 2.0s`. When pre-click check reads
`disabled=True`: wait 2s, scroll-to-bottom nudge, re-check. Repeat up to 3 times. Only stop
if still disabled after all retries (reason: `button DISABLED (persistent after 3 retries)`).
Otherwise recover and continue. Identical concept to plateau tolerance (tolerate transient
before concluding terminal).

## Validation re-run (cap=160)

Re-run with 160-click cap after fix:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Clicks done | 160 |
| Distinct URLs | 2 575 (2 551 after live-blog filter) |
| Oldest date reached | **2026-01-23** |
| Stop reason | `stage-A cap (160 clicks)` |
| Disabled-retry recoveries | **0** |
| Wall-clock | 10m 3s |

No DISABLED seen at all — not at click 127, not anywhere. Zero retry recoveries. The fix
prevents false stops structurally. Oldest date (2026-01-23) exactly matches OT44 depth probe,
confirming consistency.

**Button still active at click 160** — feed floor not yet reached. Depth is deeper than 5 months.

## DOM-growth measurement (the next blocker)

Per-click timing over 160 clicks:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| First-10 avg | 2.55s |
| Last-10 avg | 5.78s |
| Trend | **+3.23s** |

The `timeLabel` DOM walk in `_JS_EXTRACT` (up to 10 parentElement traversals + querySelectorAll
per link) causes O(n) slowdown per click as DOM grows. At ~5 000 total clicks (Stage B estimate),
extrapolation gives ~40s/click at depth — unacceptable for a multi-hour run.

**Required before full run:** drop `timeLabel` from `_JS_EXTRACT` (unused by `build_entries`,
which derives date from URL path) + switch to delta extraction (only new URLs per click, not full
re-scan). Stage B projection at current pace (linear, uncorrected): ~5 190 clicks, ~5h 21m.
With delta extraction, the per-click time should stabilize regardless of DOM depth.

## Open

- Feed floor unknown — button active at click 160 / 2026-01-23 (~5 months back). Stage B will
  determine actual depth; may reach back to CoinDesk founding (~2013) or stop at a rolling window.
- Perf fix (timeLabel-drop + delta extraction) is the prerequisite for Stage B — not yet implemented.
  Must be a separate isolated change before the uncapped run.
