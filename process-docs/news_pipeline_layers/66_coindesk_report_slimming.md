# 66 — CoinDesk proxy-riding report slimming

**Branch:** `riding-report-trim`.
Cross-reference: OT64 (`64_coindesk_watchdog_report_path.md`) — originally added `remaining_urls.txt`
write and the three-plot report to the watchdog abort path.

## Removals

### Two plot functions — `reporter.py`

`_write_ride_length_plot` (histogram of n_urls_attempted per proxy ride → `ride_lengths.png`) and
`_write_regwall_position_plot` (bar chart of regwall rate by ride position → `regwall_position.png`)
removed from `write_riding_report` (calls removed) and from the file entirely.

Dead fields pruned from `_compute_stats` return dict: `"ride_lengths"` (only consumer was
`_write_ride_length_plot`; local variable retained — still needed to compute `ride_len_stats` which
`_write_md` uses) and `"regwall_rate_by_pos"` (only consumer was `_write_regwall_position_plot`;
the computation block — `rw_by_pos`, `total_by_pos`, `max_pos`, `regwall_rate_by_pos` — removed
entirely). All other stats fields remain: `ride_len_stats`, `ride_ok_counts`, and all
count/throughput/percentile/regwall-retry fields are consumed by `_write_md` or
`_write_cumulative_plot`.

Two dead image links (`![Ride length distribution](ride_lengths.png)`,
`![Regwall rate vs position](regwall_position.png)`) removed from the `## Plots` block in
`_write_md`. Only `![Cumulative OK](cumulative.png)` remains.

**Rationale:** ride-length histogram and regwall-rate-by-position chart were overhead. The cumulative
OK plot is the primary diagnostic signal (throughput shape, stall detection). The job.md text tables
(ride-length stats via `ride_len_stats`, regwall counts) preserve the information without the plots.

### `remaining_urls.txt` — `rider.py:_abort_stall`

The `queued` drain loop (draining `state.url_queue` into a list), the `inflight` collection
(`sorted(state.in_flight_urls)`), and the `fail_log` write block (`state.job_dir / "remaining_urls.txt"`
with header + URL lines) removed from `_abort_stall`. Function header comment updated:
"Write remaining_urls.txt + job.md then os._exit(1)" → "Write job.md then os._exit(1)". The
`state.job_dir.mkdir` call, `write_riding_report` call and fallback stub, and `os._exit(1)` are
all untouched.

**Rationale:** `remaining_urls.txt` listed queue-pending + in-flight URLs at stall time. This
information is overhead — the stall is already diagnosed by the watchdog log line and the job.md
`termination: stall` field. The file will be superseded by a future error-URL logic layer (not in
scope here) that will track unresolved URLs in a structured, persistent form independent of the
watchdog abort path.

## What is kept

- `cumulative.png` + `job.md` (full content unchanged — all text sections, tables, regwall/failure
  URL lists, ride-length prose stats).
- `_write_cumulative_plot`, `_write_md`, `_compute_stats` (minus two dead fields + one dead block).
- `_abort_stall` stall detection, `state.termination = "stall"`, `state.job_dir.mkdir`,
  `write_riding_report` call + fallback stub, `os._exit(1)`.
